# Hi, I'm Kay!
I'm a software engineer living and working in Zurich, where I'm currently on the team at Google DeepMind, building infrastructure for Gemini. I'm passionate about solving complex problems, whether they involve large-scale server infrastructure or cryptography.

My journey in tech began with a focus on information security. Before joining Google, I was at ProtonMail, where I helped design and build core back-end and cryptographic features for their secure email service.

I hold a Master's in Information Security Technology and a dual Bachelor in Applied Mathematics and in Computer Science from Eindhoven University of Technology, graduating with Cum Laude honors for both degrees
